# Git for Beginners

## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with other developers.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Basic Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Core Concepts

### Repository

A repository is a directory that contains your project files and Git history.

### Commit

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

### Branch

A branch is an independent line of development. The default branch is `main`.

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a new repository |
| `git add <file>` | Stage files for commit |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Create a commit |
| `git push` | Upload commits to remote |
| `git pull` | Download and merge remote changes |
